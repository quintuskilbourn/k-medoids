# k-medoids
## bounded optimal calculation

DCC.py holds the algorithms. The Kmed class is used as a container and must be instantiated with a connected unweighted graph. 
find_central_supernode is the name of the overall algorithm, which returns the optimal TD as well as the result of several approximation algorithms.
